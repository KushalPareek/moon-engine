# moon-engine
A Game library written with Rust, compiled to WebAssembly and rendered with WebGl2. Intended to be used as my final year project.

Requires node.js and npm to be installed. 
If you do not already have these installed, a manager like [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/blob/master/README.md) is **HIGHLY** recommended.

## Run Demo

Download the latest package from this repo.

Install light-server using ```npm install -g light-server```

In the root directory of the downloaded folder, run ```light-server --serve .```


## Instructions
### Install Rust and wasm-pack
Install Rust using [rustup](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

Check that Rust installed successfully using ```rustc --version```

Install [Wasm-Pack](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/installer/).

### Ensuring npm is up-to-date
Make sure your version of npm is up-to-date with ```npm install npm@latest -g```

### Clone this repository
Either use a client/download this repo as a zip or clone using ```git clone https://github.com/polarvoid/moon-engine.git```

### Final setup
Switch to the moon-engine/moon directory.

```cd moon-engine/moon```

Build the wasm file. The initial run might take a while. Subsequent builds should be faster.

```wasm-pack build```

Switch to the www directory and install the node packages.

```
cd www
npm install
```

To run a live development server, use the command ```npm run start```

To build the application, use ```npm run build```. The files will be stored in a folder called dist/ within the www directory.
